Comments help to explain the code. They are written in different ways for HTML and CSS.

A comment in a HTML file starts `<!--` and ends `-->`. 

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---
  <!-- This is a HTML comment -->

--- /code ---

A comment in a CSS file starts `/*` and ends `*/`. 

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: style.css
line_numbers: false
---
  /* This is a CSS comment */

--- /code ---`
